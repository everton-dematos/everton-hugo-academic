abstract: In the run to improve security on Edge Devices, separation by software appears as a well-known technique that can be achieved by different means. In this work, we consider virtualization as a solution for separation. A virtualization layer has an intrinsic relationship with the underline hardware, where the processor’s architecture plays an essential role in the achieved security and software complexity. In this way, we discuss the architectural differences between MIPS and RISC-V processor families regarding virtualization support, showing how the archi- tectural differences may affect a hypervisor’s implementation in terms of performance and security. Finally, we expect that this study clarifies the existing trade-offs for virtualization and helps choose the hardware and software stacks for edge devices.
