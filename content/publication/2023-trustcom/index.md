abstract: Virtualization is a crucial technology for consolidating workloads and improving resource utilization in modern computing systems. seL4 is a small TCB (Trusted Computing Base) microkernel that can be used as a hypervisor to provide virtualization features. However, providing standard device interfaces to it remains a significant challenge in achieving secure and high-performance virtualization solutions for critical systems. To address this challenge, this paper proposes an approach that leverages the VirtIO standard through QEMU to provide a secure and efficient device virtualization solution for seL4. The feature takes advantage of seL4â€™s isolation guarantees and enables sharing of complex devices for multiple virtual machines, combined with the efficient communication interface provided by the VirtIO standard. We implemented and evaluated the approach using a set of benchmarks. The proposed approach leverages the VirtIO standard through QEMU on top of the seL4, aiming to offer a virtualization solution that accelerates development speed and enhances architectural flexibility by eliminating the need for native drivers.
